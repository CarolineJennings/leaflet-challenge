# Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation
- Using "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" from link provided. 
- Using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualisation. 

# Import and visualise the data by doing the following:
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in colour.
- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
